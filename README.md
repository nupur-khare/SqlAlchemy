This Project showcases the use of the database class in Python for seamless interaction with a 
relational database using SQLAlchemy. This class enables users to insert employee data, calculate the average salary per role, 
and create combined data frames that consolidate individual employee details with the average salary for each role.

Test cases are also added for the verification of the code functionality.
